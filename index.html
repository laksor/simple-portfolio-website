            <p>I’m originally from sleepy Suffolk in the UK. I’m a crazy dreamer and with an insatiable desire for travel and adventure who could never settle for an ordinary life or conform with the norm.
            After graduating from uni and ‘selling my soul’ as a corporate slave I started to feel like I was wasting the best years of my life behind a desk working for someone else’s passions and dreams. There had to be more to life than this!</p>
